          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Constants and utilities about visitor keys to traverse AST.

## üíø Installation

Use [npm] to install.

```bash
$ npm install eslint-visitor-keys
```

### Requirements

- [Node.js] `^12.22.0`, `^14.17.0`, or `>=16.0.0`


## üìñ Usage

To use in an ESM file:

```js
import * as evk from "eslint-visitor-keys"
```

To use in a CommonJS file:

```js
const evk = require("eslint-visitor-keys")
```

### evk.KEYS

> type: `{ [type: string]: string[] | undefined }`

Visitor keys. This keys are frozen.

This is an object. Keys are the type of [ESTree] nodes. Their values are an array of property names which have child nodes.

For example:

```
console.log(evk.KEYS.AssignmentExpression) // ‚Üí ["left", "right"]
```

### evk.getKeys(node)

> type: `(node: object) => string[]`

Get the visitor keys of a given AST node.

This is similar to `Object.keys(node)` of ES Standard, but some keys are excluded: `parent`, `leadingComments`, `trailingComments`, and names which start with `_`.

This will be used to traverse unknown nodes.

For example:

```js
const node = {
    type: "AssignmentExpression",
    left: { type: "Identifier", name: "foo" },
    right: { type: "Literal", value: 0 }
}
console.log(evk.getKeys(node)) // ‚Üí ["type", "left", "right"]
```

### evk.unionWith(additionalKeys)

> type: `(additionalKeys: object) => { [type: string]: string[] | undefined }`

Make the union set with `evk.KEYS` and the given keys.

- The order of keys is, `additionalKeys` is at first, then `evk.KEYS` is concatenated after that.
- It removes duplicated keys as keeping the first one.

For example:

```js
console.log(evk.unionWith({
    MethodDefinition: ["decorators"]
})) // ‚Üí { ..., MethodDefinition: ["decorators", "key", "value"], ... }
```

## üì∞ Change log

See [GitHub releases](https://github.com/eslint/eslint-visitor-keys/releases).

## üçª Contributing

Welcome. See [ESLint contribution guidelines](https://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/contributing/).

### Development commands

- `npm test` runs tests and measures code coverage.
- `npm run lint` checks source codes with ESLint.
- `npm run coverage` opens the code coverage report of the previous test with your default browser.
- `npm run release` publishes this package to [npm] registory.
